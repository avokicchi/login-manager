Drop-in PHP login module that's database agnostic, doesn't require any libraries, and supports remember-me functionality. 

Installation is simple

composer require avokicchi/rawrfle-login

Then just, 

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

and then use it (working on examples)

features:
- regular login
- drop in any project, database agnostic.

requirements:
- php 7.2+
- database that works with pdo

Hope this is useful to anyone. ~ Avo
